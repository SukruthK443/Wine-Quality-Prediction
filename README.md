# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project demonstrates the application of Python and machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification, to predict wine quality. By leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and optimization techniques, we can build robust models that provide valuable predictions. This experience highlights the practical applications of machine learning in the food and beverage industry, offering insights that can help winemakers improve their products.
